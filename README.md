# uv-vis-ir
Data analysis for images from the uv-vis-ir camera

## Quick start
Download the repository of images from this [Google Drive Foler](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ID0S1DbNHXsJww9g15v8_qBL540pODlu?usp=sharing) and place in a folder called `VIS_IR_DATASET`. Then run the relevant Jupyter Notebooks.

To download the relevant Python packages required for the notebooks to work run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I'd recommend working in a virtual environment if you have trouble getting the Python packages installed.

## Currently working on

- [Andrew] Working on reading an entire directory of images and merging VIS and IR images into one 4d numpy array and writing it to disk.
